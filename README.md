# FarsiScript

FarsiScript is a [Persian](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Persian) dialect of JavaScript. The goal is to make programming more accessible to beginners from South-West Asia (No! I was kidding :) it's just for fun!). FarsiScript uses informal Persian analogies to programming concepts, making it easy to get started without remembering keywords.

Thanks a lot to [UrduScript](https://github.com/asadm/urduscript)

It's highly suggested not to use this programming language for beginners.

FarsiScript transpiles to JavaScript. All JavaScript frameworks (like jQuery, UnderScore, React, etc) can be seemlessly used.

### Hello World
